# Alerts and confirmations

When you are writing custom components or pages you might need to show alerts or confirmations to the user.

For example if fetch to the API fails you might want to show an error message to the user.

AdminForth has very simple [frontend API](/docs/api/types/FrontendAPI/interfaces/FrontendAPIInterface) for this.
