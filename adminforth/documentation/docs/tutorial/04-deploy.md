# Deploy in Docker

In general you can already run your `index.ts` file which we created in [Getting Started](/docs/tutorial/01-gettingStarted.md)
with `ts-node` command in any node environment.

It will start the server on configured HTTP port and you can use any proxy like Traefik/Nginx to expose it to the internet and add SSL Layer.
